#### Final Predictive Pipeline Summary 

The predictive pipeline follows a structured approach, integrating feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment. Key models—KNN, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest—were tested to predict property prices with varying results.  

To further improve the pipeline:  
1. **Incorporate Geospatial Data**: Enhance predictions by including geographic factors like neighborhood amenities and proximity to key locations.  
2. **Advanced Modeling Techniques**: Explore ensemble methods and deep learning architectures to capture complex data patterns.  
3. **Dynamic Data Integration**: Update the model with real-time market data for enhanced relevance and accuracy.  

The deployed KNN model is highly effective for price prediction, offering real estate professionals a tool to estimate property values with confidence. Potential applications include:  
- **Fair Market Pricing**: Identify undervalued or overpriced properties.  
- **Investment Analysis**: Support decision-making for buyers and investors.  
- **Customized Recommendations**: Provide tailored property suggestions for clients based on budget and preferences.  

This predictive system positions stakeholders to navigate the Utah real estate market effectively and maximize value from their investments.
